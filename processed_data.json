[ 1 ] criminology multidisciplinary field behavioural social science , draw primarily upon research sociologist , political scientist , economist , legal sociologist , psychologist , philosopher , psychiatrist , social worker , biologist , social anthropologist , scholar law jurisprudence , well process define administration justice criminal justice system . interest criminologist include study nature crime criminal , origin criminal law , etiology crime , social reaction crime , functioning law enforcement agency penal institution . broadly said criminology directs inquiry along three line : first , investigates nature criminal law administration condition develops ; second , analyzes causation crime personality criminal ; third , study control crime rehabilitation offender . thus , criminology includes within scope activity legislative body , law-enforcement agency , judicial institution , correctional institution educational , private public social agency . modern academic criminology direct root 19th-century italian school `` criminal anthropology '' , according historian mary gibson `` caused radical refocusing criminological discussion throughout europe united state law criminal . 'italian school ' turn attacked partially supplanted country france 'sociological ' theory delinquency , retained new focus criminal . `` [ 2 ] according gibson , term criminology likely coined 1885 italian law professor raffaele garofalo criminologia [ ] . [ 2 ] late 19th century , french anthropologist paul topinard used analogous french term criminologie [ fr ] . [ 3 ] criminology grew substantially discipline first quarter twentieth century . 1900 2000 field research underwent three significant phase united state : ( 1 ) golden age research ( 1900\u20131930 ) described multiple-factor approach , ( 2 ) golden age theory ( 1930\u20131960 ) endeavored show limit systematically connecting criminological research theory , ( 3 ) 1960\u20132000 period , seen significant turning point criminology . [ 4 ] three main school thought early criminological theory , spanning period mid-18th century mid-twentieth century : classical , positivist , chicago . school thought superseded several contemporary paradigm criminology , sub-culture , control , strain , labelling , critical criminology , cultural criminology , postmodern criminology , feminist criminology , queer criminology , others discussed . classical school arose mid-18th century reflects idea utilitarian philosophy . [ 5 ] cesare beccaria , [ 6 ] author crime punishment ( 1763\u201364 ) , jeremy bentham ( inventor panopticon ) , early criminological philosopher proposed idea including : [ 7 ] school developed major reform penology society began designing prison sake extreme punishment . period also saw many legal reform , french revolution , development legal system united state . [ 9 ] positivist school argues criminal behaviour come internal external factor individual 's control . key method thought criminal born criminal made ; [ 10 ] school thought also support theory nature debate nature versus nurture . also argue criminal behavior innate within person . philosopher within school applied scientific method study human behavior . positivism comprises three segment : biological , psychological social positivism . [ 11 ] psychological positivism concept criminal act people said crime internal factor driving . social positivism , often referred sociological positivism , discus thought process criminal produced society . school claim low income level , high poverty/unemployment rate , poor educational system create motivate criminal . [ 12 ] notion criminal personality achieved school thought psychological positivism . essentially mean part individual 's personality trait align many possessed criminal , neuroticism , anti-social tendency , aggressive behavior , factor . evidence correlation , causation , personality trait criminal action . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] cesare lombroso ( 1835\u20131909 ) , italian sociologist working late 19th century , often called `` father criminology '' . [ 21 ] one key contributor biological positivism founded italian school criminology . [ 22 ] lombroso took scientific approach , insisting empirical evidence studying crime . [ 23 ] suggested physiological trait measurement cheekbone hairline , cleft palate could indicate `` atavistic '' criminal tendency . approach , whose influence came via theory phrenology charles darwin 's theory evolution , superseded . enrico ferri , student lombroso , believed social well biological factor played role , believed criminal held responsible factor causing criminality beyond control . criminologist since rejected lombroso 's biological theory since control group used study . [ 24 ] [ 25 ] sociological positivism suggests societal factor poverty , membership subculture , low level education predispose people crime . adolphe quetelet used data statistical analysis study relationship crime sociological factor . found age , gender , poverty , education , alcohol consumption important factor crime . [ 26 ] lance lochner performed three different research experiment , one supporting education reduces crime . [ 27 ] rawson w. rawson used crime statistic suggest link population density crime rate , crowded city producing crime . [ 28 ] joseph fletcher john glyde read paper statistical society london study crime distribution . [ 29 ] henry mayhew used empirical method ethnographic approach address social question poverty , gave study london labour london poor . [ 30 ] \u00e9mile durkheim viewed crime inevitable aspect society uneven distribution wealth difference among people . differential association ( sub-cultural ) posit people learn crime association . theory advocated edwin sutherland , focused `` person becomes delinquent excess definition favorable violation law definition unfavorable violation law . `` [ 31 ] associating people may condone criminal conduct , justify crime specific circumstance make one likely take view , theory . interacting type `` antisocial '' peer major cause delinquency . reinforcing criminal behavior make chronic . criminal subculture , many individual learn crime , crime rate swell area . [ 32 ] chicago school arose early twentieth century , work robert e. park , ernest burgess , urban sociologist university chicago . 1920s , park burgess identified five concentric zone often exist city grow , including `` zone transition '' , identified volatile subject disorder . 1940s , henry mckay clifford r. shaw focused juvenile delinquent , finding concentrated zone transition . chicago school school thought developed blame social structure human behavior . thought associated used within criminology , essentially take stance defending criminal criminal behavior . defense argument lie thought people act fault actually result society ( i.e . unemployment , poverty , etc . ) , people actually , fact , behaving properly . [ 33 ] chicago school sociologist adopted social ecology approach studying city postulated urban neighborhood high level poverty often experience breakdown social structure institution , family school . result social disorganization , reduces ability institution control behavior creates environment ripe deviant behavior . researcher suggested added social-psychological link . edwin sutherland suggested people learn criminal behavior older , experienced criminal may associate . theoretical perspective used criminology include psychoanalysis , functionalism , interactionism , marxism , econometrics , system theory , postmodernism , behavioural genetics , personality psychology , evolutionary psychology , etc . theory applied variety approach within base criminology particular sociology generally conflict theory structural conflict perspective sociology sociology crime . perspective broad enough , embracing diversity position . [ 34 ] social disorganization theory based work henry mckay clifford r. shaw chicago school . [ 35 ] social disorganization theory postulate neighborhood plagued poverty economic deprivation tend experience high rate population turnover . [ 36 ] theory suggests crime deviance valued within group society , 'subcultures ' 'gangs ' . group different value social norm . neighborhood also tend high population heterogeneity . [ 36 ] high turnover , informal social structure often fails develop , turn make difficult maintain social order community . since 1950s , social ecology study built social disorganization theory . many study found crime rate associated poverty , disorder , high number abandoned building , sign community deterioration . [ 36 ] [ 37 ] working middle-class people leave deteriorating neighborhood , disadvantaged portion population may remain . william julius wilson suggested poverty `` concentration effect '' , may cause neighborhood isolated mainstream society become prone violence . [ 38 ] strain theory , also known mertonian anomie , advanced american sociologist robert merton , suggests mainstream culture , especially united state , saturated dream opportunity , freedom , prosperity\u2014as merton put , american dream . people buy dream , becomes powerful cultural psychological motivator . merton also used term anomie , meant something slightly different durkheim . merton saw term meaning dichotomy society expected citizen citizen could actually achieve . therefore , social structure opportunity unequal prevents majority realizing dream , dejected turn illegitimate mean ( crime ) order realize . others retreat drop deviant subculture ( gang member , call `` hobo '' ) . robert agnew developed theory include type strain derived financial constraint . known general strain theory . [ 39 ] following chicago school strain theory , also drawing edwin sutherland 's idea differential association , sub-cultural theorist focused small cultural group fragmenting away mainstream form value meaning life . albert k. cohen tied anomie theory sigmund freud 's reaction formation idea , suggesting delinquency among lower-class youth reaction social norm middle class . [ 40 ] youth , especially poorer area opportunity scarce , might adopt social norm specific place may include `` toughness '' disrespect authority . criminal act may result youth conform norm deviant subculture . [ 41 ] richard cloward lloyd ohlin suggested delinquency result differential opportunity lower class youth . [ 42 ] youth may tempted take criminal activity , choosing illegitimate path provides lucrative economic benefit conventional , legal option minimum wage-paying job available . [ 42 ] delinquency tends occur among lower-working-class male lack resource available live impoverished area , mentioned extensively albert cohen ( cohen , 1965 ) . bias known occur among law enforcement agency , officer tend place bias minority group , without knowing sure committed crime . british sub-cultural theorist focused heavily issue class , criminal activity seen `` imaginary solution '' problem belonging subordinate class . study chicago school looked gang influence interaction gang leader observation adult . sociologist raymond d. gastil explored impact southern culture honor violent crime rate . [ 43 ] another approach made social bond social control theory . instead looking factor make people become criminal , theory try explain people become criminal . travis hirschi identified four main characteristic : `` attachment others '' , `` belief moral validity rule '' , `` commitment achievement '' , `` involvement conventional activity '' . [ 44 ] person feature characteristic , le likely become deviant ( criminal ) . hand , factor present , person likely become criminal . hirschi expanded theory idea person low self-control likely become criminal . opposed criminology theory , look people commit crime rather commit crime . [ 45 ] simple example : someone want big yacht mean buy one . person exert self-control , might try get yacht ( mean ) illegal way , whereas someone high self-control ( likely ) either wait , deny want seek intelligent intermediate solution , joining yacht club use yacht group consolidation resource without violating social norm . social bond , peer , parent , others countering effect one 's low self-control . family low socio-economic status , factor distinguishes family delinquent child , delinquent , control exerted parent chaperonage . [ 46 ] addition , theorist david matza gresham sykes argued criminal able temporarily neutralize internal moral social-behavioral constraint technique neutralization . psychoanalysis psychological theory ( therapy ) regard unconscious mind , repressed memory trauma , key driver behavior , especially deviant behavior . [ 47 ] sigmund freud talk unconscious desire pain relates psychoanalysis essay , beyond pleasure principle , . [ 47 ] freud suggested unconscious impulse 'repetition compulsion ' 'death drive ' dominate person 's creativity , leading self-destructive behavior . phillida rosnick , article mental pain social trauma , posit difference thought individual suffering traumatic unconscious pain corresponds thought feeling reflection true self . enough correlation altered state mind criminality suggest causation . [ 48 ] sander gilman , article freud making psychoanalysis , look evidence physical mechanism human brain nervous system suggests direct link unconscious desire pain punishment impulse commit crime deviant act . [ 49 ] symbolic interactionism draw phenomenology edmund husserl george herbert mead , well subcultural theory conflict theory . [ 50 ] school thought focused relationship state , medium , conservative-ruling elite le powerful group . powerful group ability become `` significant '' le powerful group ' process generating meaning . former could extent impose meaning latter ; therefore able `` label '' minor delinquent youngster criminal . youngster would often take label board , indulge crime readily , become actor `` self-fulfilling prophecy '' powerful group . later development set theory howard becker edwin lemert , mid-20th century . [ 51 ] stanley cohen developed concept `` moral panic '' describing societal reaction spectacular , alarming social phenomenon ( e.g . post-world war 2 youth culture like mod rocker uk 1964 , aid epidemic football hooliganism ) . labeling theory refers individual labeled others particular way . theory studied great detail becker . [ 52 ] originally derived sociology , regularly used criminological study . someone given label criminal may reject accept continue commit crime . even initially reject label eventually accept label becomes well known , particularly among peer . stigma become even profound label deviancy , thought stigmatization lead deviancy amplification . malcolm klein conducted test showed labeling theory affected youth offender others . [ 53 ] side spectrum , criminologist lonnie athens developed theory process brutalization parent peer usually occurs childhood result violent crime adulthood . richard rhodes ' kill describes athens ' observation domestic societal violence criminal ' background . athens rhodes reject genetic inheritance theory . [ 54 ] rational choice theory based utilitarian , classical school philosophy cesare beccaria , popularized jeremy bentham . argued punishment , certain , swift , proportionate crime , deterrent crime , risk outweighing possible benefit offender . dei delitti e delle pene ( crime punishment , 1763\u20131764 ) , beccaria advocated rational penology . beccaria conceived punishment necessary application law crime ; thus , judge simply confirm sentence law . beccaria also distinguished crime sin , advocated death penalty , well torture inhumane treatment , consider rational deterrent . philosophy replaced positivist chicago school revived 1970s writing james q. wilson , gary becker 's 1965 article crime punishment [ 55 ] george stigler 's 1970 article optimum enforcement law . [ 56 ] rational choice theory argues criminal , like people , weigh cost risk benefit deciding whether commit crime think economic term . [ 57 ] also try minimize risk crime considering time , place , situational factor . [ 57 ] becker , example , acknowledged many people operate high moral ethical constraint considered criminal rationally see benefit crime outweigh cost , probability apprehension conviction , severity punishment , well current set opportunity . public policy perspective , since cost increasing fine marginal cost increasing surveillance , one conclude best policy maximize fine minimize surveillance . perspective , crime prevention reduction measure devised increase effort required commit crime , target hardening . [ 58 ] rational choice theory also suggest increasing risk likelihood caught , added surveillance , law enforcement presence , added street lighting , measure , effective reducing crime . [ 58 ] one main difference theory bentham 's rational choice theory , abandoned criminology , bentham considered possible completely annihilate crime ( panopticon ) , becker 's theory acknowledged society could eradicate crime beneath certain level . example , 25 % supermarket 's product stolen , would easy reduce rate 15 % , quite easy reduce 5 % , difficult reduce 3 % nearly impossible reduce zero ( feat measure required would cost supermarket much would outweigh benefit ) . reveals goal utilitarianism classical liberalism tempered reduced modest proposal practically applicable . rational choice theory , linked neoliberalism , basic crime prevention environmental design underpin market reduction approach theft [ 59 ] mike sutton , systematic toolkit seeking focus attention `` crime facilitator '' tackling market stolen good [ 60 ] provide motivation thief supply theft . [ 61 ] routine activity theory , developed marcus felson lawrence cohen , draw upon control theory explains crime term crime opportunity occur everyday life . [ 62 ] crime opportunity requires element converge time place including motivated offender , suitable target victim , lack capable guardian . [ 63 ] guardian place , street , could include security guard even ordinary pedestrian would witness criminal act possibly intervene report law enforcement . [ 63 ] routine activity theory expanded john eck , added fourth element `` place manager '' rental property manager take nuisance abatement measure . [ 64 ] biosocial criminology interdisciplinary field aim explain crime antisocial behavior exploring biological factor environmental factor . contemporary criminology dominated sociological theory , biosocial criminology also recognizes potential contribution field behavioral genetics , personality psychology , evolutionary psychology . [ 65 ] various theoretical framework evolutionary neuroandrogenic theory sought explain trend criminality lens evolutionary biology . specifically , seek explain criminality much higher men woman young men likely exhibit criminal behavior . [ 66 ] see also : genetics aggression . aggressive behavior associated abnormality three principal regulatory system body : serotonin system , catecholamine system , hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis . abnormality system also known induced stress , either severe , acute stress chronic low-grade stress . [ 67 ] biosocial approach remain controversial within scientific field . [ 68 ] [ 69 ] 1968 , young british sociologist formed national deviance conference ( ndc ) group . group restricted academic consisted 300 member . ian taylor , paul walton jock young \u2013 member ndc \u2013 rejected previous explanation crime deviance . thus , decided pursue new marxist criminological approach . [ 70 ] new criminology , argued biological `` positivism '' perspective represented lombroso , han eysenck gordon trasler . [ 71 ] according marxist perspective crime , `` defiance normal \u2013 sense men consciously involved ... assuring human diversity . '' thus marxist criminologist argued support society fact human diversity , social personal , would criminalized . [ 72 ] attributed process crime creation genetic psychological fact , rather material basis given society . [ 73 ] state crime distinct field crime studied marxist criminology , considers crime costly society term overall harm/injury . marxist framework , genocide , environmental degradation , war crime occur contempt one 's fellow man , crime power . continue system control hegemony allow state crime state-corporate crime , along state-corporate non-profit criminal , continue governing people . [ 74 ] convict criminology school thought realm criminology . convict criminologist directly affected criminal justice system , oftentimes spent year inside prison system . researcher field convict criminology john irwin stephan richards argue traditional criminology better understood lived wall prison . [ 75 ] martin leyva argues `` prisonization '' oftentimes begin prison , home , community , school . [ 76 ] according rod earle , convict criminology started united state major expansion prison 1970s , u.s. still remains main focus study convict criminology . [ 77 ] queer criminology field study focus lgbt individual interaction criminal justice system . goal field study follows : legitimacy queer criminology : value pursuing criminology queer theorist perspective contested ; believe worth researching relevant field whole , result subject lack wide berth research available . hand , could argued subject highly valuable highlighting lgbt individual affected criminal justice system . research also opportunity `` queer '' curriculum criminology educational institution shifting focus controlling monitoring lgbt community liberating protecting . [ 78 ] people identify something heterosexual , queer criminology continues grow relevance . time , jurisdiction russia , uganda , ghana , government become even punitive law expand criminalisation lgbtq+ conduct , relationship , organising . [ 79 ] 'digiqueer criminology ' emerged sub discipline queer criminology aim deepen understanding relationship digital technology , lgbtq+ identity , justice . [ 79 ] [ 80 ] cultural criminology view crime control within context culture . [ 81 ] [ 82 ] ferrell belief criminologist examine action criminal , control agent , medium producer , others construct meaning crime . [ 82 ] discus action mean show dominant role culture . [ 82 ] kane add cultural criminology three trope ; village , city street , medium , male geographically influenced society 's view broadcast accepted right wrong . [ 83 ] village one engages available social activity . linking history individual location help determine social dynamic . [ 83 ] city street involves positioning oneself cultural area . full affected poverty , poor health crime , large building impact city neighborhood . [ 83 ] mass medium give all-around account environment possible subculture could exist beyond specific geographical area . [ 83 ] later naegler salman introduced feminist theory cultural criminology discussed masculinity femininity , sexual attraction sexuality , intersectional theme . [ 84 ] naegler salman believed ferrell 's mold limited could add understanding cultural criminology studying woman fit ferrell 's mold . [ 84 ] hayward would later add feminist theory , green theory well , played role cultural criminology theory lens adrenaline , soft city , transgressive subject , attentive gaze . [ 81 ] adrenaline lens deal rational choice cause person term availability , opportunity , low level social control . [ 81 ] soft city lens deal reality outside city imaginary sense reality : world transgression occurs , rigidity slanted , rule bent .

[ 81 ] , sociological perspective cultural criminology theory attempt understand environment individual determines criminal behavior . [ 82 ] relative deprivation involves process individual measure well-being materialistic worth people perceive worse comparison . [ 85 ] human fail obtain believe owed , experience anger jealousy notion wrongly disadvantaged . relative deprivation originally utilized field sociology samuel a. stouffer , pioneer theory . stouffer revealed soldier fighting world war ii measured personal success experience unit rather standard set military . [ 86 ] relative deprivation made societal , political , economic , personal factor create sense injustice . based absolute poverty , condition one meet necessary level maintain basic living standard . rather , relative deprivation enforces idea even person financially stable , still feel relatively deprived . perception relatively deprived result criminal behavior and/or morally problematic decision . [ 87 ] relative deprivation theory increasingly used partially explain crime rising living standard result rising crime level . criminology , theory relative deprivation explains people feel jealous discontent others might turn crime acquire thing afford . rural criminology study crime trend outside metropolitan suburban area . rural criminologist used social disorganization routine activity theory . fbi uniform crime report show rural community significantly different crime trend opposed metropolitan suburban area . crime rural community consists predominantly narcotic related crime production , use , trafficking narcotic . social disorganization theory used examine trend involving narcotic . [ 88 ] social disorganization lead narcotic use rural area low educational opportunity high unemployment rate . routine activity theory used examine low-level street crime theft . [ 89 ] much crime rural area explained routine activity theory often lack capable guardian rural area .
